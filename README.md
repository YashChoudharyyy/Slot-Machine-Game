A command-line casino-style game that simulates spinning reels and calculates winnings based on predefined probabilities and payouts.
Technologies Used: Python, Random Module, Object-Oriented Programming

This project is a terminal-based slot machine simulation that allows users to place bets across configurable lines and view real-time results based on randomized outcomes. The game incorporates key elements of traditional slot mechanics, including symbol probabilities, line-based betting, and reward calculations, offering an engaging and interactive experience.

Built using Python, the program leverages the random module to simulate fair symbol generation, ensuring unpredictability and balanced gameplay. Object-oriented design principles were used to create modular, maintainable components, including functions for input validation, result computation, and game loop control.

The project showcases strong problem-solving abilities, particularly in areas such as probability logic, modular system design, and user experience within a text-based interface. This application serves as a foundational exercise in backend logic development, with potential enhancements including GUI integration and more advanced reward algorithms.
